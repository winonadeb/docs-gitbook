# Quickstart

### Get started in three steps

Get your documentation site running locally and make your first customization.

#### Step 1: Set up your local environment

During the onboarding process, you created a GitHub repository with your docs content if you didn't already have one. You can find a link to this repository in your \[dashboard]\(https://dashboard.mintlify.com).

```
To clone the repository locally so that you can make and preview changes to your docs, follow the [Cloning a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) guide in the GitHub docs.
```

1\. Install the Mintlify CLI: \`npm i -g mint\` 2. Navigate to your docs directory and run: \`mint dev\` 3. Open \`http://localhost:3000\` to see your docs live!

```
<Tip>Your preview updates automatically as you edit files.</Tip>
```

#### Step 2: Deploy your changes

Install the Mintlify GitHub app from your \[dashboard]\(https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/github-app).

```
Our GitHub app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you don't need to manage deployments yourself.
```

For a first change, let's update the name and colors of your docs site.

```
1. Open `docs.json` in your editor.
2. Change the `"name"` field to your project name.
3. Update the `"colors"` to match your brand.
4. Save and see your changes instantly at `http://localhost:3000`.

<Tip>Try changing the primary color to see an immediate difference!</Tip>
```

#### Step 3: Go live

1\. Commit and push your changes. 2. Your docs will update and be live in moments!
